Project: Glasgow Gritting, http://gccgritting.iriss.org.uk
Subproject: TrackYou
Author: Lesley Duff, lesley.duff@iriss.org.uk
Organisation: IRISS
Date created: 18 Jan 2013
Requirements: PHP 5.3+. Production code known to run under PHP 5.3.18 

These PHP scripts are used to process XML files generated by the GPS 
Tracking system used by the council on their fleet of gritting vehicles i.e. 
"TrackYou", http://www.trackyou.co.uk
Data is gathered from the gritting vehicles every 15 minutes and the scripts 
are run as cron jobs on the server.

N.B. TrackYou wrote custom code to use their API to create the XML files for the 
council. The XML processing scripts here are tightly bound to the structure of 
those files. 

The XML files as input are processed to generate Open Data freely downloadable 
from the project website.
